# CND212_verification_project

This project was completed for the digital verification course (CND212) during the 9-month training in the Center of Nanoelectronics and Devices (CND - The American University in Cairo).

The project was to develop a UVM test environment for the ALU module the 8051 processor. The specific ALU RTL design being tested was adapted from the OpenCores project which is available at 
https://opencores.org/websvn/filedetails?repname=8051&path=%2F8051%2Ftrunk%2Frtl%2Fverilog%2Foc8051_alu.v

Unfortunately, since there is no specification file for the ALU module to describe its behaviour, we could not develop a reference model for the ALU to be used for error checking.
